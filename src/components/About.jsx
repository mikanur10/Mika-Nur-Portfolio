      <h2 className="title"> About Me</h2>
      <p className="paragraph">Junior software developer with 5-years of experience in enterprise technology sales. My years of experience with end-users and technologists inform my ability to create a product that meets the needs of all stakeholders.
      I decided to transition into software engineering due to my experience in the technology industry and desire to build the very applications I was marketing.
      My approach to development is both empathetic and communicative - which enables me to anticipate customer needs and build great applications. I am able to bring these ideas to life using modern frameworks and efficient, scalable code. I look forward to operating at the epicenter of development, product, marketing and design. </p>
