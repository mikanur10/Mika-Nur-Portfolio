      <p className="paragraph">Junior software developer with 5-years of experience in enterprise technology sales. My experience with end-users and technologists have informed my ability to create a product that meets the needs of the user.
      I decided to transition into software engineering due to my experience in the technology industry and desire to build the very applications I was marketing.
      My ability to empathize with people and communicate effectively equips me to anticipate customer needs and build great applications. I am able to bring these ideas to life using modern frameworks and efficient, scalable code.</p>
